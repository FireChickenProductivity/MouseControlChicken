January 26 2025: 
- Added ability to use modifier keys with actions from the user.mouse_control_chicken_action list.
- Fixed MacOS window tracking. Added user.user.mouse_control_chicken_window_following_delay setting for controlling how long to wait before redrawing the grid around the window/screen. Increasing this may help if you still run into the bug.
